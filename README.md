# Mastering OpenTelemetry and Observability Book Supplemental Material

This repository contains all material and examples used in the Mastering OpenTelemetry and Observability book. 

The directory structure is based on the chapters:

- Chapter 1: Example log records

If any modifications are required post-publication they will be captured in the README of the chapter changed.
In addition, the examples will be updated to stay current to the latest OTel changes (roughly every six months).

If you experience any issues with or have any suggestions for the book, please file an issue!
